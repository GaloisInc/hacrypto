.SH NAME
srptool \- GnuTLS SRP tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B srptool
.\" Mixture of short (flag) options and long options
.RB [ \-\fIflag\fP " [\fIvalue\fP]]... [" \-\-\fIopt\-name\fP "[[=| ]\fIvalue\fP]]..."
.PP
All arguments must be options.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Simple program that emulates the programs in the Stanford SRP (Secure
Remote Password) libraries using GnuTLS.  It is intended for use in  places
where you don't expect SRP authentication to be the used for system users.
.sp
In  brief,  to use SRP you need to create two files. These are the password
file that holds the users and the verifiers associated with  them  and  the
configuration file to hold the group parameters (called tpasswd.conf).
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.BR  \-d " \fInumber\fP, " \-\-debug "=" \fInumber\fP
Enable debugging.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The value of \fInumber\fP is constrained to being:
.in +4
.nf
.na
in the range  0 through 9999
.fi
.in -4
.sp
Specifies the debug level.
.TP
.BR  \-i " \fInumber\fP, " \-\-index "=" \fInumber\fP
specify the index of the group parameters in tpasswd.conf to use.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The default \fInumber\fP for this option is:
.ti +4
 1
.sp
.TP
.BR  \-u " \fIstring\fP, " \-\-username "=" \fIstring\fP
specify a username.
.sp
.TP
.BR  \-p " \fIstring\fP, " \-\-passwd "=" \fIstring\fP
specify a password file.
.sp
.TP
.BR  \-s " \fInumber\fP, " \-\-salt "=" \fInumber\fP
specify salt size.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
.sp
.TP
.BR  \-\-verify
just verify the password..
.sp
Verifies the password provided against the password file.
.TP
.BR  \-v " \fIstring\fP, " \-\-passwd\-conf "=" \fIstring\fP
specify a password conf file..
.sp
Specify a filename or a PKCS #11 URL to read the CAs from.
.TP
.BR  \-\-create\-conf "=\fIstring\fP"
Generate a password configuration file..
.sp
This generates a password configuration file (tpasswd.conf)
containing the required for TLS parameters.
.TP
.BR \-h , " \-\-help"
Display usage information and exit.
.TP
.BR \-! , " \-\-more-help"
Pass the extended usage information through a pager.
.TP
.BR \-v " [{\fIv|c|n\fP}]," " \-\-version" "[={\fIv|c|n\fP}]"
Output version of program and exit.  The default mode is `v', a simple
version.  The `c' mode will print copyright information and `n' will
print the full copyright notice.
.SH EXAMPLES
To create \fItpasswd.conf\fP which holds the g and n values for SRP protocol
(generator and a large prime), run:
.br
.in +4
.nf
$ srptool \-\-create\-conf /etc/tpasswd.conf
.in -4
.fi
.sp
This command will create \fI/etc/tpasswd\fP and will add user 'test' (you
will also be prompted for a password). Verifiers are stored by default
in the way libsrp expects.
.br
.in +4
.nf
$ srptool \-\-passwd /etc/tpasswd \-\-passwd\-conf /etc/tpasswd.conf \-u test
.in -4
.fi
.sp
.sp
This command will check against a password. If the password matches
the one in \fI/etc/tpasswd\fP you will get an ok.
.br
.in +4
.nf
$ srptool \-\-passwd /etc/tpasswd \-\-passwd\-conf /etc/tpasswd.conf \-\-verify \-u test
.in -4
.fi
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
One of the following exit values will be returned:
.TP
.BR 0 " (EXIT_SUCCESS)"
Successful program execution.
.TP
.BR 1 " (EXIT_FAILURE)"
The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.
.TP
.BR 70 " (EX_SOFTWARE)"
libopts had an internal operational error.  Please report
it to autogen-users@lists.sourceforge.net.  Thank you.
