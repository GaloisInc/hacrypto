Add cipher implementation
=========================

Steps:
	1. Make a copy of 
"CipherName_StateSizeInBits_KeySizeInBits_IVSizeInBits_v01" directory in 
"ciphers" directory.

	2. Rename the copy of the directory to follow the pattern 
"CipherName_StateSizeInBits_KeySizeInBits_IVSizeInBits_v01".
			Example: "Trivium_288_80_80"
		Note: If you add several implementation for the same cipher (for example
 one optimized for RAM and one optimized for speed) you can increase the cipher 
directory name suffix like "_v02", "_v03", etc.
			Example: Trivium_288_80_80_v02

	3. Add cipher implementation:
		a. Add cipher state size, key size, iv size and test stream size in 
"constants.h".
		
		b. Declare cipher S-boxes and other constants in "constants.h" and 
define them in "constants.c" or in any other "*.c" file, excepting "*.c" files 
from Section 3.c.
			Note: You can use any data type based on "RAM_DATA_*" 
("RAM_DATA_BYTE", "RAM_DATA_WORD", "RAM_DATA_DOUBLE_WORD") or "ROM_DATA_*" 
("ROM_DATA_BYTE", "ROM_DATA_WORD", "ROM_DATA_DOUBLE_WORD") depending where you 
want to store them. 
					If you want to define your custom data types in different 
scenarios for different architectures use "data_types.h" file.
			Example:
				in "data_types.h"
					#define SBOX1_BYTE ROM_DATA_BYTE
					#define READ_SBOX1_BYTE READ_ROM_DATA_BYTE

					#define SBOX2_WORD RAM_DATA_WORD
					#define READ_SBOX2_WORD READ_RAM_DATA_WORD

				in "constants.h"
					extern SBOX1_BYTE SBox1[4];
					extern SBOX2_WORD SBox2[2];
					extern RAM_DATA_DOUBLE_WORD SBox[1];

				in "constants.c"
					SBOX1_BYTE SBox1[4] = { 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04 };
					SBOX2_WORD SBox2[2] = { 0x0201, 0x0403 };
					RAM_DATA_DOUBLE_WORD SBox[1] = { 0x04030201 };

		c. If you have constants used by one or more of the following operations
 (setup, encrypt), you can define them in separate "*.c" files and declare them 
in "constants.h" file according with the following rules:

			* Do not use the following names for the added "*.c" files:
				"main"
				"cipher"
				"scenario1"
				"common"
				"test_vectors"
				"setup"
				"encrypt"

			* Do not add constant definition in "*.h" files, except for macros. 
Declare the constants in "constants.h" file and define them in "*.c" files.

			* Add the "*.c" name withouth the "." separator and extension in
 "implementation.info" file, in the corresponding section(s) ("SetupConstants:",
 "EncryptConstants:"). If a section contains more than one file, use ", " as 
separator.
			
			Example:
				- if you add the following constant "*.c" files:
					+ "f.c" that contains common constants for setup and 
encryption
					+ "g.c" that contains constants for setup
					+ "h.c" that contains constants for encryption

				- the "implementation.info" file should contain:
					SetupConstants: f, g
					EncryptConstants: f, h
			Note: Do not add constants definitions in files that contain cipher 
implementation ("setup.c", "encrypt.c" and so on).

		d. Declare & define the cipher test vectors in "test_vectors.c".

		e. Implement the setup in "setup.c" using the following function 
signature:
				void Setup(uint8_t *state, uint8_t *key, uint8_t *iv);
			Note: After running the setup the key "key" and IV "iv" should
 not be modified.
			Note: To read data types based on "RAM_DATA_*" 
("RAM_DATA_BYTE", "RAM_DATA_WORD", "RAM_DATA_DOUBLE_WORD") or "ROM_DATA_*" 
("ROM_DATA_BYTE", "ROM_DATA_WORD", "ROM_DATA_DOUBLE_WORD") macros use the 
associated macros.
			Example:
				uint8_t SBox1Value = READ_SBOX1_DATA_BYTE(SBox1[0]);
				uint16_t SBox2Value = READ_SBOX2_DATA_WORD(SBox2[0]);
				uint32_t SBoxValue = READ_RAM_DATA_DOUBLE_WORD(SBox[0]);
			Note: Do not add constants definitions in files that contain cipher 
implementation ("setup.c", "encrypt.c" and so on).

		f. Implement the encryption in "encrypt.c" using the following function 
signature:
				void Encrypt(uint8_t *state, uint8_t *stream, uint16_t length);
			Note: To read data types based on "RAM_DATA_*" 
("RAM_DATA_BYTE", "RAM_DATA_WORD", "RAM_DATA_DOUBLE_WORD") or "ROM_DATA_*" 
("ROM_DATA_BYTE", "ROM_DATA_WORD", "ROM_DATA_DOUBLE_WORD") macros use the 
associated macros.
			Example:
				uint8_t SBox1Value = READ_SBOX1_DATA_BYTE(SBox1[0]);
				uint16_t SBox2Value = READ_SBOX2_DATA_WORD(SBox2[0]);
				uint32_t SBoxValue = READ_RAM_DATA_DOUBLE_WORD(SBox[0]);
			Note: Do not add constants definitions in files that contain cipher 
implementation ("setup.c", "encrypt.c" and so on).

		g. Add a description of your implementation in "implementation.info" 
file, in the "ImplementationDescription:" section.
			Example:
				ImplementationDescription: Trivium small code size

		h. If you have common functions used by two or more of the following 
operations (setup, encrypt), you can add them in separate "*.c" and "*.h" files 
according with the following rules. The same rules apply when you just want to 
make the code cleaner by implementing some functions in separate files.

			* Do not use the following names for the added "*.c" and/or "*.h" 
files:
				"main"
				"cipher"
				"scenario1"
				"common"
				"constants"
				"test_vectors"
				"setup"
				"encrypt" 

			* Do not add constant definition in "*.h" files, except for macros. 
For constants either use "constants.c" and "constants.h" (See 3.b.), either use 
your own "*.c" and "*.h" files, but declare the constants in "*.h" files and 
define them in "*.c" files.

			* Add the "*.c" name withouth the "." separator and extension in
 "implementation.info" file, in the corresponding section(s) ("SetupCode:", 
"EncryptCode:"). If a section contains more than one file, use ", " as 
separator.
			
			Example:
				- if you add the following files:
					+ "f.c" that contains common code parts for setup and 
encryption
					+ "g.c" that contains a part of the setup code
					+ "h.c" that contains a part of the encryption code

				- the "implementation.info" file should contain:
					SetupCode: f, g
					EncryptCode: f, h

		i. Indicate the implementation language for all supported platforms in 
"implementation.info" file.
			Example:
				ImplementationAVR: ASM
				ImplementationMSP: C
				ImplementationARM: ASM
				ImplementationPC: 
			Note: You don't have to set the implementation language to "C" 
because this is the default value.

	4. Fill the cipher implementation authors in "implementation.info"
		Example:
			ImplementationAuthors: John Doe



Coding rules
============

1. Do not use the following data types: int, char, short, long and the 
combinations of them. Instead use: int8_t, uint8_t, int16_t, uint16_t, int32_t, 
uint32_t, int64_t and uint64_t data types which are declared in "<stdint.h>".

2. Try to keep the code clean and easy to read.

3. Use the "/* ... */" comment style, unless you comment a set of test vectors, 
in which case is indicated to use "// ...".

4. The framework is designed with several debug and test cases, so you should 
not add "printf" or other function calls in your code, at least not in the final 
version.



Using the makefile
==================

The makefile can build the cipher in different scenarios and test cases, 
either in debug or in release mode. To see a list of the makefile options, just 
type "make" or "make help" in the cipher "source" directory. You can also type 
"make -f ./../source/Makefile" or "make -f ./../source/Makefile help" from 
either cipher "source" directory or cipher "build" directory. For simplicity we 
assume that you call the makefile from the cipher "source" directory.


Debug mode
	Build  & test cipher in debug mode for PC
		make clean
		make cipher
		make test-cipher

	Build & test scenario 1 in debug mode for PC
		make clean
		make scenario1
		make test-scenario1


Release mode
	Build cipher in release mode for PC
		make clean
		make pc

	Build cipher in release mode for AVR
		make clean
		make avr

	Build cipher in release mode for MSP
		make clean
		make msp

	Build cipher in release mode for ARM
		make clean
		make arm

	Build scenario 1 in release mode for PC
		make clean
		make pc-scenario1

	Build scenario 1 in release mode for AVR
		make clean
		make avr-scenario1

	Build scenario 1 in release mode for MSP
		make clean
		make msp-scenario1

	Build scenario 1 in release mode for ARM
		make clean
		make arm-scenario1


If your cipher builds without errors or warnings and the two tests 
(test-cipher, test-scenario1) run as expected the cipher implementation is 
correctly integrated into the framework.

Note: If you encounter warnings during the build, you should fix the code such 
that they do not appear.



Constraints
===========

1. The implemented cipher should be able to process a stream greater than 1 byte
 or equal with 1 byte.

2. The values defined in "constants.h" for "STATE_SIZE", "KEY_SIZE", "IV_SIZE"
and "TEST_STREAM_SIZE" must be in bytes.



Getting the cipher metrics
==========================
