8.1 Creating a TLS server certificate
=====================================

Here is a brief run up on how to create a server certificate. It has
actually been done this way to get a certificate from CAcert to be used
on a real server.  It has only been tested with this CA, but there
shouldn't be any problem to run this against any other CA.

   Before you start, make sure that gpg-agent is running.  As there is
no need for a configuration file, you may simply enter:

       $ gpgsm-gencert.sh >a.p10
       Key type
        [1] RSA
        [2] Existing key
        [3] Direct from card
       Your selection: 1
       You selected: RSA

   I opted for creating a new RSA key. The other option is to use an
already existing key, by selecting `2' and entering the so-called
keygrip.  Running the command `gpgsm --dump-secret-key USERID' shows
you this keygrip.  Using `3' offers another menu to create a
certificate directly from a smart card based key.

   Let's continue:

       Key length
        [1] 1024
        [2] 2048
       Your selection: 1
       You selected: 1024

   The script offers  two common key sizes. With the current setup of
CAcert, it does not make much sense to use a 2k key; their policies need
to be revised anyway (a CA root key valid for 30 years is not really
serious).

       Key usage
        [1] sign, encrypt
        [2] sign
        [3] encrypt
       Your selection: 1
       You selected: sign, encrypt

   We want to sign and encrypt using this key. This is just a suggestion
and the CA may actually assign other key capabilities.

   Now for some real data:

       Name (DN)
       > CN=kerckhoffs.g10code.com

   This is the most important value for a server certificate. Enter here
the canonical name of your server machine. You may add other virtual
server names later.

       E-Mail addresses (end with an empty line)
       >

   We don't need email addresses in a server certificate and CAcert
would anyway ignore such a request. Thus just hit enter.

   If you want to create a client certificate for email encryption, this
would be the place to enter your mail address (e.g. <joe@example.org>).
You may enter as many addresses as you like, however the CA may not
accept them all or reject the entire request.

       DNS Names (optional; end with an empty line)
       > www.g10code.com
       DNS Names (optional; end with an empty line)
       > ftp.g10code.com
       DNS Names (optional; end with an empty line)
       >

   Here I entered the names of the servers which actually run on the
machine given in the DN above. The browser will accept a certificate for
any of these names. As usual the CA must approve all of these names.

       URIs (optional; end with an empty line)
       >

   It is possible to insert arbitrary URIs into a certificate; for a
server certificate this does not make sense.

   We have now entered all required information and `gpgsm' will
display what it has gathered and ask whether to create the certificate
request:

       Parameters for certificate request to create:
            1	Key-Type: RSA
            2	Key-Length: 1024
            3	Key-Usage: sign, encrypt
            4	Name-DN: CN=kerckhoffs.g10code.com
            5	Name-DNS: www.g10code.com
            6	Name-DNS: ftp.g10code.com

       Really create such a CSR?
        [1] yes
        [2] no
       Your selection: 1
       You selected: yes

   `gpgsm' will now start working on creating the request. As this
includes the creation of an RSA key it may take a while. During this
time you will be asked 3 times for a passphrase to protect the created
private key on your system. A pop up window will appear to ask for it.
The first two prompts are for the new passphrase and for re-entering it;
the third one is required to actually create the certificate signing
request.

   When it is ready, you should see the final notice:

       gpgsm: certificate request created

   Now, you may look at the created request:

       $ cat a.p10
       -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----
       MIIBnzCCAQgCAQAwITEfMB0GA1UEAxMWa2VyY2tob2Zmcy5nMTBjb2RlLmNvbTCB

       -----END CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----
       $

   You may now proceed by logging into your account at the CAcert
website, choose `Server Certificates - New', check `sign by class 3 root
certificate', paste the above request block into the text field and
click on `Submit'.

   If everything works out fine, a certificate will be shown. Now run

     $ gpgsm --import

   and paste the certificate from the CAcert page into your terminal
followed by a Ctrl-D

       gpgsm:               imported: 1

   gpgsm tells you that it has imported the certificate. It is now
associated with the key you used when creating the request. The root
certificate has not been found, so you may want to import it from the
CACert website.

   To see the content of your certificate, you may now enter:

       $ gpgsm -K kerckhoffs.g10code.com
       /home/foo/.gnupg/pubring.kbx
       ---------------------------
       Serial number: 4C

           key usage: digitalSignature keyEncipherment
       ext key usage: clientAuth (suggested), serverAuth (suggested), [...]
         fingerprint: 0F:9C:27:B2:DA:05:5F:CB:33:19:D8:E9:65:B9:BD:4F:B1:98:CC:57

   I used `-K' above because this will only list certificates for which
a private key is available.  To see more details, you may use
`--dump-secret-keys' instead of `-K'.

   To make actual use of the certificate you need to install it on your
server. Server software usually expects a PKCS\#12 file with key and
certificate. To create such a file, run:

       $ gpgsm --export-secret-key-p12 -a >kerckhoffs-cert.pem

   You will be asked for the passphrase as well as for a new passphrase
to be used to protect the PKCS\#12 file. The file now contains the
certificate as well as the private key:

       $ cat kerckhoffs-cert.pem
       Issuer ...: /CN=CAcert Class 3 Root/OU=http:\x2f\x2fwww.CA[...]
       Serial ...: 4C
       Subject ..: /CN=kerckhoffs.g10code.com
           aka ..: (dns-name www.g10code.com)
           aka ..: (dns-name ftp.g10code.com)

       -----BEGIN PKCS12-----
       MIIHlwIBAzCCB5AGCSqGSIb37QdHAaCCB4EEggd9MIIHeTk1BJ8GCSqGSIb3DQEu
       [...many more lines...]
       -----END PKCS12-----
       $

   Copy this file in a secure way to the server, install it there and
delete the file then. You may export the file again at any time as long
as it is available in GnuPG's private key database.

9 Notes pertaining to certain OSes.
***********************************

GnuPG has been developed on GNU/Linux systems and is know to work on
almost all Free OSes.  All modern POSIX systems should be supported
right now, however there are probably a lot of smaller glitches we need
to fix first.  The major problem areas are:

   * For logging to sockets and other internal operations the
     `fopencookie' function (`funopen' under *BSD) is used.  This is a
     very convenient function which makes it possible to create outputs
     in a structures and easy maintainable way.  The drawback however
     is that most proprietary OSes don't support this function.  At
     g10 Code we have looked into several ways on how to overcome this
     limitation but no sufficiently easy and maintainable way has been
     found.  Porting _glibc_ to a general POSIX system is of course an
     option and would make writing portable software much easier; this
     it has not yet been done and the system administrator would need
     to cope with the GNU specific admin things in addition to the
     generic ones of his system.

     We have now settled to use explicit stdio wrappers with a
     functionality similar to funopen.  Although the code for this has
     already been written (_libestream_), we have not yet changed GnuPG
     to use it.

     This means that on systems not supporting either `funopen' or
     `fopencookie', logging to a socket won't work, prompts are not
     formatted as pretty as they should be and `gpgsm''s `LISTKEYS'
     Assuan command does not work.

   * We are planning to use file descriptor passing for interprocess
     communication.  This will allow us save a lot of resources and
     improve performance of certain operations a lot.  Systems not
     supporting this won't gain these benefits but we try to keep them
     working the standard way as it is done today.

   * We require more or less full POSIX compatibility.  This has been
     around for 15 years now and thus we don't believe it makes sense to
     support non POSIX systems anymore.  Well, we of course the usual
     workarounds for near POSIX systems well be applied.

     There is one exception of this rule: Systems based the Microsoft
     Windows API (called here _W32_) will be supported to some extend.

9.1 Microsoft Windows Notes
===========================

Current limitations are:

   * `gpgconf' does not create backup files, so in case of trouble your
     configuration file might get lost.

   * `watchgnupg' is not available.  Logging to sockets is not possible.

   * The periodical smartcard status checking done by `scdaemon' is not
     yet supported.

10 How to solve problems
************************

Everyone knows that software often does not do what it should do and
thus there is a need to track down problems.  We call this debugging in
a reminiscent to the moth jamming a relay in a Mark II box back in 1947.

   Most of the problems a merely configuration and user problems but
nevertheless there are the most annoying ones and responsible for many
gray hairs.  We try to give some guidelines here on how to identify and
solve the problem at hand.

10.1 Debugging Tools
====================

The GnuPG distribution comes with a couple of tools, useful to help find
and solving problems.

* Menu:

* kbxutil::        Scrutinizing a keybox file.


File: gnupg.info,  Node: kbxutil,  Up: Debugging Tools

10.1.1 Scrutinizing a keybox file
---------------------------------

A keybox is a file format used to store public keys along with meta
information and indices.  The commonly used one is the file
`pubring.kbx' in the `.gnupg' directory. It contains all X.509
certificates as well as OpenPGP keys(1) .

When called the standard way, e.g.:

   `kbxutil ~/.gnupg/pubring.kbx'

it lists all records (called blobs) with there meta-information in a
human readable format.

To see statistics on the keybox in question, run it using

   `kbxutil --stats ~/.gnupg/pubring.kbx'

and you get an output like:

     Total number of blobs:       99
                    header:        1
                     empty:        0
                   openpgp:        0
                      x509:       98
               non flagged:       81
            secret flagged:        0
         ephemeral flagged:       17

   In this example you see that the keybox does not have any OpenPGP
keys but contains 98 X.509 certificates and a total of 17 keys or
certificates are flagged as ephemeral, meaning that they are only
temporary stored (cached) in the keybox and won't get listed using the
usual commands provided by `gpgsm' or `gpg'. 81 certificates are stored
in a standard way and directly available from `gpgsm'.

To find duplicated certificates and keyblocks in a keybox file (this
should not occur but sometimes things go wrong), run it using

   `kbxutil --find-dups ~/.gnupg/pubring.kbx'

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Well, OpenPGP keys are not implemented, `gpg' still used the
keyring file `pubring.gpg'

10.2 Various hints on debugging.
================================

   * How to find the IP address of a keyserver

     If a round robin URL of is used for a keyserver (e.g.
     subkeys.gnupg.org); it is not easy to see what server is actually
     used.  Using the keyserver debug option as in

           gpg --keyserver-options debug=1 -v --refresh-key 1E42B367

     is thus often helpful.  Note that the actual output depends on the
     backend and may change from release to release.



File: gnupg.info,  Node: Common Problems,  Next: Architecture Details,  Prev: Debugging Hints,  Up: Debugging

10.3 Commonly Seen Problems
===========================

   * Error code `Not supported' from Dirmngr

     Most likely the option `enable-ocsp' is active for gpgsm but
     Dirmngr's OCSP feature has not been enabled using `allow-ocsp' in
     `dirmngr.conf'.

   * The Curses based Pinentry does not work

     The far most common reason for this is that the environment
     variable `GPG_TTY' has not been set correctly.  Make sure that it
     has been set to a real tty devce and not just to `/dev/tty'; i.e.
     `GPG_TTY=tty' is plainly wrong; what you want is `GPG_TTY=`tty`'
     -- note the back ticks.  Also make sure that this environment
     variable gets exported, that is you should follow up the setting
     with an `export GPG_TTY' (assuming a Bourne style shell). Even for
     GUI based Pinentries; you should have set `GPG_TTY'. See the
     section on installing the `gpg-agent' on how to do it.

   * SSH hangs while a popping up pinentry was expected

     SSH has no way to tell the gpg-agent what terminal or X display it
     is running on.  So when remotely logging into a box where a
     gpg-agent with SSH support is running, the pinentry will get
     popped up on whatever display the gpg-agent has been started.  To
     solve this problem you may issue the command

          echo UPDATESTARTUPTTY | gpg-connect-agent

     and the next pinentry will pop up on your display or screen.
     However, you need to kill the running pinentry first because only
     one pinentry may be running at once.  If you plan to use ssh on a
     new display you should issue the above command before invoking ssh
     or any other service making use of ssh.

   * Exporting a secret key without a certificate

     I may happen that you have created a certificate request using
     `gpgsm' but not yet received and imported the certificate from the
     CA.  However, you want to export the secret key to another machine
     right now to import the certificate over there then.  You can do
     this with a little trick but it requires that you know the
     approximate time you created the signing request.  By running the
     command

            ls -ltr ~/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d

     you get a listing of all private keys under control of `gpg-agent'.
     Pick the key which best matches the creation time and run the
     command

            /usr/local/libexec/gpg-protect-tool --p12-export ~/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d/FOO >FOO.p12

     (Please adjust the path to `gpg-protect-tool' to the appropriate
     location). FOO is the name of the key file you picked (it should
     have the suffix `.key').  A Pinentry box will pop up and ask you
     for the current passphrase of the key and a new passphrase to
     protect it in the pkcs#12 file.

     To import the created file on the machine you use this command:

            /usr/local/libexec/gpg-protect-tool --p12-import --store  FOO.p12

     You will be asked for the pkcs#12 passphrase and a new passphrase
     to protect the imported private key at its new location.

     Note that there is no easy way to match existing certificates with
     stored private keys because some private keys are used for Secure
     Shell or other purposes and don't have a corresponding certificate.

   * A root certificate does not verify

     A common problem is that the root certificate misses the required
     basicConstraints attribute and thus `gpgsm' rejects this
     certificate.  An error message indicating "no value" is a sign for
     such a certificate.  You may use the `relax' flag in
     `trustlist.txt' to accept the certificate anyway.  Note that the
     fingerprint and this flag may only be added manually to
     `trustlist.txt'.

   * Error message: "digest algorithm N has not been enabled"

     The signature is broken.  You may try the option
     `--extra-digest-algo SHA256' to workaround the problem.  The
     number N is the internal algorithm identifier; for example 8
     refers to SHA-256.

   * The Windows version does not work under Wine

     When running the W32 version of `gpg' under Wine you may get an
     error messages like:

          gpg: fatal: WriteConsole failed: Access denied

     The solution is to use the command `wineconsole'.

     Some operations like gen-key really want to talk to the console
     directly for increased security (for example to prevent the
     passphrase from appearing on the screen).  So, you should use
     `wineconsole' instead of `wine', which will launch a windows
     console that implements those additional features.

   * Why does GPG's -search-key list weird keys?

     For performance reasons the keyservers do not check the keys the
     same way `gpg' does.  It may happen that the listing of keys
     available on the keyservers shows keys with wrong user IDs or with
     user Ids from other keys.  If you try to import this key, the bad
     keys or bad user ids won't get imported, though.  This is a bit
     unfortunate but we can't do anything about it without actually
     downloading the keys.

GNU General Public License
**************************

                        Version 3, 29 June 2007

     Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. `http://fsf.org/'

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
     license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.

   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program-to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you
have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software,
or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the
manufacturer can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the
aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The
systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for
individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.
Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the
practice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in
other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains
in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of
users.

   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                         TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  0. Definitions.

     "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
     License.

     "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other
     kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

     "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
     License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
     "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

     To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the
     work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the
     making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified
     version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

     A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work
     based on the Program.

     To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
     permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
     infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it
     on a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes
     copying, distribution (with or without modification), making
     available to the public, and in some countries other activities as
     well.

     To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
     parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user
     through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
     conveying.

     An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
     to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
     feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
     tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to
     the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may
     convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this
     License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or
     options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this
     criterion.

  1. Source Code.

     The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
     for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any
     non-source form of a work.

     A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an
     official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in
     the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming
     language, one that is widely used among developers working in that
     language.

     The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything,
     other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal
     form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that
     Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work
     with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface
     for which an implementation is available to the public in source
     code form.  A "Major Component", in this context, means a major
     essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the
     specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work
     runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code
     interpreter used to run it.

     The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
     the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
     work) run the object code and to modify the work, including
     scripts to control those activities.  However, it does not include
     the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally
     available free programs which are used unmodified in performing
     those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example,
     Corresponding Source includes interface definition files
     associated with source files for the work, and the source code for
     shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work
     is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data
     communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
     parts of the work.

     The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
     regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
     Source.

     The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
     same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

     All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
     copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
     conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
     permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running
     a covered work is covered by this License only if the output,
     given its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License
     acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as
     provided by copyright law.

     You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
     convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise
     remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the
     sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for
     you, or provide you with facilities for running those works,
     provided that you comply with the terms of this License in
     conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.
     Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so
     exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on
     terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your
     copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

     Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
     the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section
     10 makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

     No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
     measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under
     article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December
     1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of
     such measures.

     When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
     circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
     circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License
     with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention
     to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of
     enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal
     rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

     You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
     receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
     appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
     keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
     non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
     code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
     give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

     You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
     and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

     You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
     produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
     terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
     conditions:

       a. The work must carry prominent notices stating that you
          modified it, and giving a relevant date.

       b. The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
          released under this License and any conditions added under
          section 7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in
          section 4 to "keep intact all notices".

       c. You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
          License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
          License will therefore apply, along with any applicable
          section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all
          its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.  This License
          gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but
          it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately
          received it.

       d. If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
          Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has
          interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal
          Notices, your work need not make them do so.

     A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
     works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered
     work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger
     program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is
     called an "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting
     copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the
     compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
     Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this
     License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

     You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
     of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
     machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this
     License, in one of these ways:

       a. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
          Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
          customarily used for software interchange.

       b. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
          written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for
          as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that
          product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
          either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the
          software in the product that is covered by this License, on a
          durable physical medium customarily used for software
          interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of
          physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access
          to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no
          charge.

       c. Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of
          the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
          alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially,
          and only if you received the object code with such an offer,
          in accord with subsection 6b.

       d. Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
          place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access
          to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same
          place at no further charge.  You need not require recipients
          to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code.
          If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the
          Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated
          by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying
          facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to
          the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.
          Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you
          remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long
          as needed to satisfy these requirements.

       e. Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
          provided you inform other peers where the object code and
          Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the
          general public at no charge under subsection 6d.


     A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
     excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need
     not be included in conveying the object code work.

     A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means
     any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
     family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
     incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product
     is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of
     coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user,
     "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of
     product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the
     way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is
     expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product
     regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial,
     industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the
     only significant mode of use of the product.

     "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
     procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
     install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that
     User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.
     The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
     functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or
     interfered with solely because modification has been made.

     If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,
     or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying
     occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession
     and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in
     perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction
     is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this
     section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But
     this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party
     retains the ability to install modified object code on the User
     Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

     The requirement to provide Installation Information does not
     include a requirement to continue to provide support service,
     warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or
     installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it
     has been modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied
     when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the
     operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for
     communication across the network.

     Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
     provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is
     publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the
     public in source code form), and must require no special password
     or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

     "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of
     this License by making exceptions from one or more of its
     conditions.  Additional permissions that are applicable to the
     entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in
     this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable
     law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program,
     that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the
     entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to
     the additional permissions.

     When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
     remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part
     of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
     removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
     additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
     for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material
     you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright
     holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License
     with terms:

       a. Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from
          the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

       b. Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices
          or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate
          Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

       c. Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
          or requiring that modified versions of such material be
          marked in reasonable ways as different from the original
          version; or

       d. Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors
          or authors of the material; or

       e. Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
          trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

       f. Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
          material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified
          versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to
          the recipient, for any liability that these contractual
          assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

     All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
     restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as
     you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that
     it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further
     restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document
     contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or
     conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work
     material governed by the terms of that license document, provided
     that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or
     conveying.

     If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
     must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
     additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
     where to find the applicable terms.

     Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in
     the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
     the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

     You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
     provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
     modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
     under this License (including any patent licenses granted under
     the third paragraph of section 11).

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new
     licenses for the same material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

     You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
     run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
     occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer
     transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require
     acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you
     permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions
     infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,
     by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your
     acceptance of this License to do so.

 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

     Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
     receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
     propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not
     responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this
     License.

     An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
     organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
     organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a
     covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
     transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
     licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or
     could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to
     possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the
     predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it
     with reasonable efforts.

     You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
     rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you
     may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for
     exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not
     initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
     lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making,
     using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any
     portion of it.

 11. Patents.

     A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
     License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.
     The work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor
     version".

     A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
     owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
     hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner,
     permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its
     contributor version, but do not include claims that would be
     infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the
     contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, "control"
     includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner
     consistent with the requirements of this License.

     Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
     royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential
     patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and
     otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its
     contributor version.

     In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any
     express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to
     enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a
     patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To
     "grant" such a patent license to a party means to make such an
     agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

     If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent
     license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available
     for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this
     License, through a publicly available network server or other
     readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the
     Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
     yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular
     work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements
     of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream
     recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge
     that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work
     in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a
     country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
     country that you have reason to believe are valid.

     If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
     arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
     covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
     receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate,
     modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the
     patent license you grant is automatically extended to all
     recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

     A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
     the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
     conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that
     are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a
     covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third
     party that is in the business of distributing software, under
     which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of
     your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third
     party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered
     work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection
     with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made
     from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with
     specific products or compilations that contain the covered work,
     unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license
     was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

     Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
     any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
     otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

     If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy
     simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
     pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it
     at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to
     collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you
     convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those
     terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying
     the Program.

 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
     permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
     under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a
     single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms
     of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the
     covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero
     General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through
     a network will apply to the combination as such.

 14. Revised Versions of this License.

     The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.
     Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
     version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
     concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
     General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that numbered version or of any later version published by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a
     version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose
     any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

     If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
     versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

     Later license versions may give you additional or different
     permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
     author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
     later version.

 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

     THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
     APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
     COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS"
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
     INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE
     RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
     SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
     NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 16. Limitation of Liability.

     IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES
     AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
     FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
     THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
     BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
     PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
     PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
     THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

     If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
     above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
     reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely
     approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in
     connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
     liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.


                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at
     your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program.  If not, see `http://www.gnu.org/licenses/'.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice
like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     PROGRAM Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR
     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
     type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are
     welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;
     type `show c' for details.

   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your
program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would
use an "about box".

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  For more information on this, and how to apply and follow
the GNU GPL, see `http://www.gnu.org/licenses/'.

   The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But first,
please read `http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html'.

Glossary
********

`ARL'
     The _Authority Revocation List_ is technical identical to a CRL
     but used for CAs and not for end user certificates.

`Chain model'
     Verification model for X.509 which uses the creation date of a
     signature as the date the validation starts and in turn checks
     that each certificate has been issued within the time frame, the
     issuing certificate was valid.  This allows the verification of
     signatures after the CA's certificate expired.  The validation
     test also required an online check of the certificate status.  The
     chain model is required by the German signature law.  See also
     _Shell model_.

`CMS'
     The _Cryptographic Message Standard_ describes a message format
     for encryption and digital signing.  It is closely related to the
     X.509 certificate format.  CMS was formerly known under the name
     `PKCS#7' and is described by `RFC3369'.

`CRL'
     The _Certificate Revocation List_ is a list containing
     certificates revoked by the issuer.

`CSR'
     The _Certificate Signing Request_ is a message send to a CA to ask
     them to issue a new certificate.  The data format of such a signing
     request is called PCKS#10.

`OpenPGP'
     A data format used to build a PKI and to exchange encrypted or
     signed messages.  In contrast to X.509, OpenPGP also includes the
     message format but does not explicitly demand a specific PKI.
     However any kind of PKI may be build upon the OpenPGP protocol.

`Keygrip'
     This term is used by GnuPG to describe a 20 byte hash value used
     to identify a certain key without referencing to a concrete
     protocol.  It is used internally to access a private key.  Usually
     it is shown and entered as a 40 character hexadecimal formatted
     string.

`OCSP'
     The _Online Certificate Status Protocol_ is used as an alternative
     to a CRL.  It is described in `RFC 2560'.

`PSE'
     The _Personal Security Environment_ describes a database to store
     private keys.  This is either a smartcard or a collection of files
     on a disk; the latter is often called a Soft-PSE.

`Shell model'
     The standard model for validation of certificates under X.509.  At
     the time of the verification all certificates must be valid and
     not expired.  See also _Chain mode_.

`X.509'
     Description of a PKI used with CMS.  It is for example defined by
     `RFC3280'.
