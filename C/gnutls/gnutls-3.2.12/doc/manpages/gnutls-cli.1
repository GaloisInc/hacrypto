Fail to connect if a known certificate has changed.
The \fIno\-strict\-tofu\fP form will disable the option.

.SH EXAMPLES
.br
\fBConnecting using PSK authentication\fP
.br
To connect to a server using PSK authentication, you need to enable the choice of PSK by using a cipher priority parameter such as in the example below. 
.br
.in +4
.nf
$ ./gnutls\-cli \-p 5556 localhost \-\-pskusername psk_identity \
    \-\-pskkey 88f3824b3e5659f52d00e959bacab954b6540344 \
    \-\-priority NORMAL:\-KX\-ALL:+ECDHE\-PSK:+DHE\-PSK:+PSK
Resolving 'localhost'...
Connecting to '127.0.0.1:5556'...
- PSK authentication.
- Version: TLS1.1
- Key Exchange: PSK
- Cipher: AES\-128\-CBC
- MAC: SHA1
- Compression: NULL
- Handshake was completed
- Simple Client Mode:
.in -4
.fi
By keeping the \-\-pskusername parameter and removing the \-\-pskkey parameter, it will query only for the password during the handshake. 
.sp
.br
\fBListing ciphersuites in a priority string\fP
.br
To list the ciphersuites in a priority string:
.br
.in +4
.nf
$ ./gnutls\-cli \-\-priority SECURE192 \-l
Cipher suites for SECURE192
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_AES_256_CBC_SHA384         0xc0, 0x24	TLS1.2
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_AES_256_GCM_SHA384         0xc0, 0x2e	TLS1.2
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_AES_256_GCM_SHA384           0xc0, 0x30	TLS1.2
TLS_DHE_RSA_AES_256_CBC_SHA256             0x00, 0x6b	TLS1.2

.sp
Certificate types: CTYPE\-X.509
Protocols: VERS\-TLS1.2, VERS\-TLS1.1, VERS\-TLS1.0, VERS\-SSL3.0, VERS\-DTLS1.0

\fBConnecting using a PKCS #11 token\fP
.br
To connect to a server using a certificate and a private key present in a PKCS #11 token you 
need to substitute the PKCS 11 URLs in the x509certfile and x509keyfile parameters.
.sp
Those can be found using "p11tool \-\-list\-tokens" and then listing all the objects in the
needed token, and using the appropriate.
.br
.in +4
.nf
$ p11tool \-\-list\-tokens
.sp
Token 0:
URL: pkcs11:model=PKCS15;manufacturer=MyMan;serial=1234;token=Test
Label: Test
Manufacturer: EnterSafe
Model: PKCS15
Serial: 1234
.sp
$ p11tool \-\-login \-\-list\-certs "pkcs11:model=PKCS15;manufacturer=MyMan;serial=1234;token=Test"
.sp
Object 0:
URL: pkcs11:model=PKCS15;manufacturer=MyMan;serial=1234;token=Test;object=client;object\-type=cert
Type: X.509 Certificate
Label: client
ID: 2a:97:0d:58:d1:51:3c:23:07:ae:4e:0d:72:26:03:7d:99:06:02:6a
.sp
$ export MYCERT="pkcs11:model=PKCS15;manufacturer=MyMan;serial=1234;token=Test;object=client;object\-type=cert"
$ export MYKEY="pkcs11:model=PKCS15;manufacturer=MyMan;serial=1234;token=Test;object=client;object\-type=private"
.sp
$ gnutls\-cli www.example.com \-\-x509keyfile $MYKEY \-\-x509certfile MYCERT
.in -4
.fi
Notice that the private key only differs from the certificate in the object\-type.
