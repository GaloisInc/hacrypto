E.3 Datagram TLS API
====================

The prototypes for the following functions lie in 'gnutls/dtls.h'.

gnutls_dtls_cookie_send
-----------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_dtls_cookie_send (gnutls_datum_t * KEY, void *
          CLIENT_DATA, size_t CLIENT_DATA_SIZE, gnutls_dtls_prestate_st
          * PRESTATE, gnutls_transport_ptr_t PTR, gnutls_push_func
          PUSH_FUNC)
     KEY: is a random key to be used at cookie generation

     CLIENT_DATA: contains data identifying the client (i.e.  address)

     CLIENT_DATA_SIZE: The size of client's data

     PRESTATE: The previous cookie returned by
     'gnutls_dtls_cookie_verify()'

     PTR: A transport pointer to be used by 'push_func'

     PUSH_FUNC: A function that will be used to reply

     This function can be used to prevent denial of service attacks to a
     DTLS server by requiring the client to reply using a cookie sent by
     this function.  That way it can be ensured that a client we
     allocated resources for (i.e.  'gnutls_session_t' ) is the one that
     the original incoming packet was originated from.

     This function must be called at the first incoming packet, prior to
     allocating any resources and must be succeeded by
     'gnutls_dtls_cookie_verify()' .

     *Returns:* the number of bytes sent, or a negative error code.

     *Since:* 3.0

gnutls_dtls_cookie_verify
-------------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_dtls_cookie_verify (gnutls_datum_t * KEY, void
          * CLIENT_DATA, size_t CLIENT_DATA_SIZE, void * _MSG, size_t
          MSG_SIZE, gnutls_dtls_prestate_st * PRESTATE)
     KEY: is a random key to be used at cookie generation

     CLIENT_DATA: contains data identifying the client (i.e.  address)

     CLIENT_DATA_SIZE: The size of client's data

     _MSG: An incoming message that initiates a connection.

     MSG_SIZE: The size of the message.

     PRESTATE: The cookie of this client.

     This function will verify the received message for a valid cookie.
     If a valid cookie is returned then it should be associated with the
     session using 'gnutls_dtls_prestate_set()' ;

     This function must be called after 'gnutls_dtls_cookie_send()' .

     *Returns:* 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) on success, or a negative error
     code.

     *Since:* 3.0

gnutls_dtls_get_data_mtu
------------------------

 -- Function: unsigned int gnutls_dtls_get_data_mtu (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' structure.

     This function will return the actual maximum transfer unit for
     application data.  I.e.  DTLS headers are subtracted from the
     actual MTU which is set using 'gnutls_dtls_set_mtu()' .

     *Returns:* the maximum allowed transfer unit.

     *Since:* 3.0

gnutls_dtls_get_mtu
-------------------

 -- Function: unsigned int gnutls_dtls_get_mtu (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' structure.

     This function will return the MTU size as set with
     'gnutls_dtls_set_mtu()' .  This is not the actual MTU of data you
     can transmit.  Use 'gnutls_dtls_get_data_mtu()' for that reason.

     *Returns:* the set maximum transfer unit.

     *Since:* 3.0

gnutls_dtls_get_timeout
-----------------------

 -- Function: unsigned int gnutls_dtls_get_timeout (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' structure.

     This function will return the milliseconds remaining for a
     retransmission of the previously sent handshake message.  This
     function is useful when DTLS is used in non-blocking mode, to
     estimate when to call 'gnutls_handshake()' if no packets have been
     received.

     *Returns:* the remaining time in milliseconds.

     *Since:* 3.0

gnutls_dtls_prestate_set
------------------------

 -- Function: void gnutls_dtls_prestate_set (gnutls_session_t SESSION,
          gnutls_dtls_prestate_st * PRESTATE)
     SESSION: a new session

     PRESTATE: contains the client's prestate

     This function will associate the prestate acquired by the cookie
     authentication with the client, with the newly established session.

     This functions must be called after a successful
     'gnutls_dtls_cookie_verify()' and should be succeeded by the actual
     DTLS handshake using 'gnutls_handshake()' .

     *Since:* 3.0

gnutls_dtls_set_data_mtu
------------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_dtls_set_data_mtu (gnutls_session_t SESSION,
          unsigned int MTU)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' structure.

     MTU: The maximum unencrypted transfer unit of the session

     This function will set the maximum size of the *unencrypted*
     records which will be sent over a DTLS session.  It is equivalent
     to calculating the DTLS packet overhead with the current encryption
     parameters, and calling 'gnutls_dtls_set_mtu()' with that value.
     In particular, this means that you may need to call this function
     again after any negotiation or renegotiation, in order to ensure
     that the MTU is still sufficient to account for the new protocol
     overhead.

     In most cases you only need to call 'gnutls_dtls_set_mtu()' with
     the maximum MTU of your transport layer.

     *Returns:* 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) on success, or a negative error
     code.

     *Since:* 3.1

gnutls_dtls_set_mtu
-------------------

 -- Function: void gnutls_dtls_set_mtu (gnutls_session_t SESSION,
          unsigned int MTU)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' structure.

     MTU: The maximum transfer unit of the transport

     This function will set the maximum transfer unit of the transport
     that DTLS packets are sent over.  Note that this should exclude the
     IP (or IPv6) and UDP headers.  So for DTLS over IPv6 on an Ethenet
     device with MTU 1500, the DTLS MTU set with this function would be
     1500 - 40 (IPV6 header) - 8 (UDP header) = 1452.

     *Since:* 3.0

gnutls_dtls_set_timeouts
------------------------

 -- Function: void gnutls_dtls_set_timeouts (gnutls_session_t SESSION,
          unsigned int RETRANS_TIMEOUT, unsigned int TOTAL_TIMEOUT)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' structure.

     RETRANS_TIMEOUT: The time at which a retransmission will occur in
     milliseconds

     TOTAL_TIMEOUT: The time at which the connection will be aborted, in
     milliseconds.

     This function will set the timeouts required for the DTLS handshake
     protocol.  The retransmission timeout is the time after which a
     message from the peer is not received, the previous messages will
     be retransmitted.  The total timeout is the time after which the
     handshake will be aborted with 'GNUTLS_E_TIMEDOUT' .

     The DTLS protocol recommends the values of 1 sec and 60 seconds
     respectively.

     If the retransmission timeout is zero then the handshake will
     operate in a non-blocking way, i.e., return 'GNUTLS_E_AGAIN' .

     To disable retransmissions set a 'retrans_timeout' larger than the
     'total_timeout' .

     *Since:* 3.0

gnutls_record_get_discarded
---------------------------

 -- Function: unsigned int gnutls_record_get_discarded (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' structure.

     Returns the number of discarded packets in a DTLS connection.

     *Returns:* The number of discarded packets.

     *Since:* 3.0

     TLIST: is a 'gnutls_x509_trust_list_t' structure

     FLAGS: must be zero

     This function sets a trust list in the
     gnutls_certificate_credentials_t structure.

     and must not be deallocated.  It will be automatically deallocated
     when the 'res' structure is deinitialized.

gnutls_x509_crt_get_authority_info_access
-----------------------------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_crt_get_authority_info_access
          (gnutls_x509_crt_t CRT, unsigned int SEQ, int WHAT,
          gnutls_datum_t * DATA, unsigned int * CRITICAL)
     CRT: Holds the certificate

     SEQ: specifies the sequence number of the access descriptor (0 for
     the first one, 1 for the second etc.)

     WHAT: what data to get, a 'gnutls_info_access_what_t' type.

     DATA: output data to be freed with 'gnutls_free()' .

     CRITICAL: pointer to output integer that is set to non-0 if the
     extension is marked as critical (may be 'NULL' )

     This function extracts the Authority Information Access (AIA)
     extension, see RFC 5280 section 4.2.2.1 for more information.  The
     AIA extension holds a sequence of AccessDescription (AD) data:

     <informalexample><programlisting> AuthorityInfoAccessSyntax ::=
     SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF AccessDescription

     AccessDescription ::= SEQUENCE { accessMethod OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
     accessLocation GeneralName } </programlisting></informalexample>

     The 'seq' input parameter is used to indicate which member of the
     sequence the caller is interested in.  The first member is 0, the
     second member 1 and so on.  When the 'seq' value is out of bounds,
     'GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE' is returned.

     The type of data returned in 'data' is specified via 'what' which
     should be 'gnutls_info_access_what_t' values.

     If 'what' is 'GNUTLS_IA_ACCESSMETHOD_OID' then 'data' will hold the
     accessMethod OID (e.g., "1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1").

     If 'what' is 'GNUTLS_IA_ACCESSLOCATION_GENERALNAME_TYPE' , 'data'
     will hold the accessLocation GeneralName type (e.g.,
     "uniformResourceIdentifier").

     If 'what' is 'GNUTLS_IA_URI' , 'data' will hold the accessLocation
     URI data.  Requesting this 'what' value leads to an error if the
     accessLocation is not of the "uniformResourceIdentifier" type.

     If 'what' is 'GNUTLS_IA_OCSP_URI' , 'data' will hold the OCSP URI.
     Requesting this 'what' value leads to an error if the accessMethod
     is not 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1 aka OSCP, or if accessLocation is not of
     the "uniformResourceIdentifier" type.

     If 'what' is 'GNUTLS_IA_CAISSUERS_URI' , 'data' will hold the
     caIssuers URI. Requesting this 'what' value leads to an error if
     the accessMethod is not 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.2 aka caIssuers, or if
     accessLocation is not of the "uniformResourceIdentifier" type.

     More 'what' values may be allocated in the future as needed.

     If 'data' is NULL, the function does the same without storing the
     output data, that is, it will set 'critical' and do error checking
     as usual.

     The value of the critical flag is returned in * 'critical' .
     Supply a NULL 'critical' if you want the function to make sure the
     extension is non-critical, as required by RFC 5280.

     *Returns:* 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' on success,
     'GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST' on invalid 'crt' ,
     'GNUTLS_E_CONSTRAINT_ERROR' if the extension is incorrectly marked
     as critical (use a non-NULL 'critical' to override),
     'GNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_ALGORITHM' if the requested OID does not match
     (e.g., when using 'GNUTLS_IA_OCSP_URI' ), otherwise a negative
     error code.

     *Since:* 3.0

     SERIAL_SIZE: Holds the size of the serial field (may be null)

     CRITICAL: will be non-zero if the extension is marked as critical
     (may be null)

     This function will return the X.509 authority key identifier when
     stored as a general name (authorityCertIssuer) and serial number.

     Because more than one general names might be stored 'seq' can be
     used as a counter to request them all until
     'GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE' is returned.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     'GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE' if the extension is not
     present, otherwise a negative error value.

     CRITICAL: will be non-zero if the extension is marked as critical
     (may be null)

     This function will return the X.509v3 certificate authority's key
     identifier.  This is obtained by the X.509 Authority Key identifier
     extension field (2.5.29.35).  Note that this function only returns
     the keyIdentifier field of the extension and
     'GNUTLS_E_X509_UNSUPPORTED_EXTENSION' , if the extension contains
     the name and serial number of the certificate.  In that case
     'gnutls_x509_crt_get_authority_key_gn_serial()' may be used.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     'GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE' if the extension is not
     present, otherwise a negative error value.

     CERT: should contain a 'gnutls_x509_crt_t' structure

     CRITICAL: will be non-zero if the extension is marked as critical

     CA: pointer to output integer indicating CA status, may be NULL,
     value is 1 if the certificate CA flag is set, 0 otherwise.

     PATHLEN: pointer to output integer indicating path length (may be
     NULL), non-negative error codes indicate a present
     pathLenConstraint field and the actual value, -1 indicate that the
     field is absent.

     This function will read the certificate's basic constraints, and
     return the certificates CA status.  It reads the basicConstraints
     X.509 extension (2.5.29.19).

     *Returns:* If the certificate is a CA a positive value will be
     returned, or (0) if the certificate does not have CA flag set.  A
     negative error code may be returned in case of errors.  If the
     certificate does not contain the basicConstraints extension
     GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE will be returned.

     When the SAN type is otherName, it will extract the data in the
     otherName's value field, and 'GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME' is returned.
     You may use 'gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_othername_oid()' to
     get the corresponding OID and the "virtual" SAN types (e.g.,
     'GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME_XMPP' ).

     If an otherName OID is known, the data will be decoded.  Otherwise
     the returned data will be DER encoded, and you will have to decode
     it yourself.  Currently, only the RFC 3920 id-on-xmppAddr SAN is
     recognized.

     *Returns:* the alternative subject name type on success, one of the
     enumerated 'gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t' .  It will return
     'GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER' if 'san_size' is not large enough to
     hold the value.  In that case 'san_size' will be updated with the

     CRITICAL: will be non-zero if the extension is marked as critical
     (may be null)

     This function will return the alternative names, contained in the
     given certificate.  It is the same as
     'gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_name()' except for the fact that
     it will return the type of the alternative name in 'san_type' even
     if the function fails for some reason (i.e.  the buffer provided is
     not enough).

     *Returns:* the alternative subject name type on success, one of the
     enumerated 'gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t' .  It will return
     'GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER' if 'san_size' is not large enough to
     hold the value.  In that case 'san_size' will be updated with the
     required size.  If the certificate does not have an Alternative
     name with the specified sequence number then
     'GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE' is returned.

     'gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_name()' returned
     'GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME' .

     If 'oid' is null then only the size will be filled.  The 'oid'
     returned will be null terminated, although 'oid_size' will not
     account for the trailing null.

     *Returns:* the alternative subject name type on success, one of the
     enumerated gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t.  For supported OIDs, it
     will return one of the virtual (GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME_*) types, e.g.
     'GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME_XMPP' , and 'GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME' for
     unknown OIDs.  It will return 'GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER' if
     'ian_size' is not large enough to hold the value.  In that case
     'ian_size' will be updated with the required size.  If the
     certificate does not have an Alternative name with the specified
     sequence number and with the otherName type then
     'GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE' is returned.

     ASCII or UTF-8 encoded.

     Some helper macros with popular OIDs can be found in gnutls/x509.h
     With this function you can only set the known OIDs.  You can test
     for known OIDs using 'gnutls_x509_dn_oid_known()' .  For OIDs that
     are not known (by gnutls) you should properly DER encode your data,
     and call this function with 'raw_flag' set.

     Normally you do not need to call this function, since the signing

     NAME: a pointer to the CN name, may be NULL (but MUST then be added
     later)

     SIZEOF_NAME: holds the size of 'name'

     This function will set the subject in 'crt' to the end entity's
     'eecrt' subject name, and add a single Common Name component 'name'
     of size 'sizeof_name' .  This corresponds to the required proxy
     certificate naming style.  Note that if 'name' is 'NULL' , you MUST
     set it later by using 'gnutls_x509_crt_set_dn_by_oid()' or similar.

     SERIAL_SIZE: Holds the size of the serial field.

     This function will set the X.509 certificate's serial number.
     While the serial number is an integer, it is often handled as an
     opaque field by several CAs.  For this reason this function accepts
     any kind of data as a serial number.  To be consistent with the
     X.509/PKIX specifications the provided 'serial' should be a
     big-endian positive number (i.e.  it's leftmost bit should be
     zero).

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

gnutls_x509_crt_set_subject_alternative_name

          const char * DATA_STRING)
     CRT: a certificate of type 'gnutls_x509_crt_t'

     TYPE: is one of the gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t enumerations

     DATA_STRING: The data to be set, a (0) terminated string

     This function will set the subject alternative name certificate
     extension.  This function assumes that data can be expressed as a
     null terminated string.

     The name of the function is unfortunate since it is incosistent
     with 'gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_name()' .

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

gnutls_x509_crt_set_subject_alt_name
------------------------------------

----------------------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_crt_set_subject_key_id (gnutls_x509_crt_t
          CERT, const void * ID, size_t ID_SIZE)
     CERT: a certificate of type 'gnutls_x509_crt_t'

     ID: The key ID

     ID_SIZE: Holds the size of the subject key ID field.

     This function will set the X.509 certificate's subject key ID
     extension.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

          unsigned int VERSION)
     CRT: a certificate of type 'gnutls_x509_crt_t'

     VERSION: holds the version number.  For X.509v1 certificates must
     be 1.

     This function will set the version of the certificate.  This must
     be one for X.509 version 1, and so on.  Plain certificates without
     extensions must have version set to one.

     To create well-formed certificates, you must specify version 3 if
     you use any certificate extensions.  Extensions are created by
     functions such as 'gnutls_x509_crt_set_subject_alt_name()' or
     'gnutls_x509_crt_set_key_usage()' .

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

--------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_crt_sign (gnutls_x509_crt_t CRT,
          gnutls_x509_crt_t ISSUER, gnutls_x509_privkey_t ISSUER_KEY)
     CRT: a certificate of type 'gnutls_x509_crt_t'

     ISSUER: is the certificate of the certificate issuer

     ISSUER_KEY: holds the issuer's private key

     This function is the same a 'gnutls_x509_crt_sign2()' with no

     ISSUER: is the certificate of the certificate issuer

     ISSUER_KEY: holds the issuer's private key

     DIG: The message digest to use, 'GNUTLS_DIG_SHA1' is a safe choice

     FLAGS: must be 0

     This function will sign the certificate with the issuer's private
     key, and will copy the issuer's information into the certificate.

     This must be the last step in a certificate generation since all
     the previously set parameters are now signed.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

gnutls_x509_crt_verify

     VERIFY: will hold the certificate verification output.

     This function will try to verify the given certificate and return
     its status.  Note that a verification error does not imply a
     negative return status.  In that case the 'verify' status is set.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

gnutls_x509_dn_deinit
---------------------

     OUTPUT_DATA: will contain a DN PEM or DER encoded

     OUTPUT_DATA_SIZE: holds the size of output_data (and will be
     replaced by the actual size of parameters)

     This function will export the DN to DER or PEM format.

     If the buffer provided is not long enough to hold the output, then
     * 'output_data_size' is updated and 'GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER'
     will be returned.

     If the structure is PEM encoded, it will have a header of "BEGIN
     NAME".

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

gnutls_x509_dn_export2

     The output buffer is allocated using 'gnutls_malloc()' .

     If the structure is PEM encoded, it will have a header of "BEGIN
     NAME".

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.1.3

     DN: a pointer to DN

     IRDN: index of RDN

     IAVA: index of AVA.

     AVA: Pointer to structure which will hold output information.

     Get pointers to data within the DN. The format of the 'ava'
     structure is shown below.

     struct gnutls_x509_ava_st { gnutls_datum_t oid; gnutls_datum_t
     value; unsigned long value_tag; };

     The X.509 distinguished name is a sequence of sequences of strings
     and this is what the 'irdn' and 'iava' indexes model.

     Note that 'ava' will contain pointers into the 'dn' structure which
     in turns points to the original certificate.  Thus you should not
     modify any data or deallocate any of those.

     This is a low-level function that requires the caller to do the
     value conversions when necessary (e.g.  from UCS-2).

     *Returns:* Returns 0 on success, or an error code.

gnutls_x509_dn_import
---------------------

     DATA: should contain a DER encoded RDN sequence

     This function parses an RDN sequence and stores the result to a
     'gnutls_x509_dn_t' structure.  The structure must have been
     initialized with 'gnutls_x509_dn_init()' .  You may use
     'gnutls_x509_dn_get_rdn_ava()' to decode the DN.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 2.4.0

     The object returned must be deallocated using
     'gnutls_x509_dn_deinit()' .

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 2.4.0

------------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_dn_oid_known (const char * OID)
     OID: holds an Object Identifier in a null terminated string

     This function will inform about known DN OIDs.  This is useful
     since functions like 'gnutls_x509_crt_set_dn_by_oid()' use the
     information on known OIDs to properly encode their input.  Object
     Identifiers that are not known are not encoded by these functions,
     and their input is stored directly into the ASN.1 structure.  In
     that case of unknown OIDs, you have the responsibility of DER
     encoding your data.

     *Returns:* 1 on known OIDs and 0 otherwise.

gnutls_x509_dn_oid_name
